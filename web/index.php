                Tower of God, 신의 탑 (in hanja 神의 塔), sinui tap, literally means "Tower of God", is a Manhwa series created by the Korean artist SIU that takes place as a Talse Uzer Story. Tower of God centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion. As the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years.
